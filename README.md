# my_ftp
Minimalist ftp server and client i did as an excercise.


#### CLient ###

Change the way i choose the port that will be opened to listen for the server. If i put 0 as a port parameter the sistem will chose something. Then i need to check the port of the socket.

Handle two arguments on get and put correctly.
Do something apropiate when there is an error with bind.
